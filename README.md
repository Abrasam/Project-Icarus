# Project-Icarus
This is a piece of software which allows two way communications with an airborne HAB payload.
This is being developed for the UKHAS and is my A-Level Computer Science coursework for AQA.
This project will be regularly updated and hopefully, when finished forked and improved by the active HAB community.
For information on HAB (High Altitube Ballooning) see ukhas.org.uk or come talk to us on #highaltitude on freenode.
